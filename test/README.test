fedora-review unit tests.
=========================

This directory contains the unit tests for fedora-review. They can be run
either in a cloned git repository, or as installed from the
fedora-review-test-package

When using the installed package in /usr/share/fedora-review/test it must
first be copied to an area where its writeable e. g.,
   $ cp -ar /usr/share/fedora-review/test .
   $ cd test

This way, the installed version is tested. When running direct from git repo
only the git repo variant is used, even if there is a instelled version.

The tests could be run either by the run-scripts.py wrapper, or directly.
   $ export REVIEW_LOGLEVEL=warning
   $ ./run-tests.py
or (not on EL6):
   $ python -m unittest discover -v

The REVIEW_LOGLEVEL could be given other values, and there some other
environment variables as well. Some examples:

To display lot's of data when hunting down bugs:
    $ export REVIEW_LOGLEVEL=debug
    $ ./run-tests.py

To disable slow tests:
    $ export REVIEW_FAST_TEST=1
    $ ./run-tests.py

To display a 'git status' after each test:
    $ export REVIEW_TEST_GIT_STATUS=1
    $ ./run-tests.py

Running a single test file:
    $ python -m unittest test_misc

Running a single test case:
    $ python -m unittest test_misc.TestMisc.test_sources
or (only solution on EL6, works for all test_*.py files):
    $ ./test_dist.py dogfood

Occasionally, mock is locked in a bad state, making tests
fail.  To recover:
    # rm -rf /var/lib/mock/*
    $ mock --init
